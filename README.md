# Full Stack Open 2025 (University of Helsinki)

## About this repository

This repository contains my exercises for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course.

> This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.
