# Phonebook App (Express)

## About this folder

This folder contains the code for the part #3 [Node.js and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/) of the Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki) course.

It is an implementation of a Node application that returns a hardcoded list of phonebook entries.

### Why another repository?

Due to the nature of the part #3 exercises and the need for a deployment using [Render](https://render.com), a dedicated repo was created.

The code in this folder is a mirror to [that repository](https://github.com/jjesus-dev/phonebook_backend).
